## About me

I am 35 years old. I graduated from Izhevsk State Technical University in 2013. My specialty is bachelor in construction and technology. I am currently working as a construction engineer. When I wanted to automate my routine work, I got interested in programming. Studying the topic of programming, it became interesting for me to delve into it and get a new specialty and get a job in this area. My strengths that help me achieve my goal: good learning ability, ability to concentrate on a task, ability to perform routine tasks, perseverance.

## Code example

Example of solving a task on the platform codewars.com (kata^ Data Reverse)

```function dataReverse(data) {
  let subarray = []; //массив в который будет выведен результат.
  for (let i = 0; i < (data.length / 8); i++){
    subarray[i] = data.slice((i*8), (i*8) + 8);
}
  let revarray = subarray.reverse();
  let result = [];
  revarray.forEach((item) => result = result.concat(item));
  return result;
  // Your code here
}
```
